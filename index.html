      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Mohammad Masood Hassan H A, and I am an Information
        Science student at the National Institute of Engineering in Mysore. I am
        currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree and working on personal tech
        projects to improve my skills in full-stack web development. I believe
        in solving real-world problems and continuously learning, especially in
        the field of AI and emerging technologies. Outside of tech, I enjoy
        watching anime, going on weekend tours, and reading self-development
        books. My goal is to develop innovative software that helps individuals
        in their daily lives.
